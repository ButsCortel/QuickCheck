A simple Attendance Logger application (JAVA) that uses built-in webcam to read qr codes, check if it exists from records,
and log it in a seperate excel file. This was originally designed for classroom teachers to eliminate handwritten 
attendance logging and minimizing human error overall.

I made this project as a beginner, as seen on how "spaghettified" it is. 
This project was made for my personal improvement in programming.
